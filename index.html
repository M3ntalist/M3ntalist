    <h2>Let's work together...</h2>
    <p>Currently looking for a job in Cape Town, South Africa</p>
    <p>I am a highly motivated and progress-focused Operations Manager with a long-standing background in
this industry. With a track record of initiative and dependability, I have devised strategic initiatives which
I believe will prove valuable to Initiate International.<br>
<br>Throughout my career, I have perfected my leadership and strong communication skills abilities. I am a
capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency.
In my previous role, I contributed critical thinking, customer service, and people management toward
team efforts and business improvements, progressive-mind and in tune with new developments in my
field. I have proven to be effective and collaborative with strong management talents.<br>
<br>I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions with my team and I coordinate activities to achieve a common goal.
My goal for many years was to become a Managing Director. Eleven years ago I became Operations
Manager. Now as I look forward to my career, I’d like to build and manage larger teams and continue
advancing as a leader. I’ve finally enjoyed mentoring and leading a team, even more than I enjoyed
working as an individual contributor earlier in my career. </p></section>
